            <p><code>In 1992 the Club was contacted by the Hogan family and assisted them in preserving a beautiful parcel of forested land and in its donation to the City as parkland, creating the Hogan Family Nature Park. In 1994 when upland development necessitated the development of Willband Creek Park and Detention Ponds, the Club was involved in providing interpretive signage and habitat development planning ideas. More recently, over the last 5 years, the Club along with Abbotsford Christian Middle School student volunteers have installed and maintained over 50 swallow boxes and 12 wood duck boxes, planted thousands of native trees and shrubs, removed invasive blackberry and installed beaver protection around many trees within Willband Creek Park. The Club’s most significant project in the Park was the Fall 2017 completion of the Co-op Community Viewing Platform thanks to the help of significant in-kind donations and funding from the ‘Co-op Community Spaces Program’.

            <h2><u><strong>OUR VISSION</strong></u></h2>
            <p><code>Our vision is of a peaceful and sustainable world based on societies living in harmony with nature.

We envision a society of interdependent people living in dignity, wholeness and fulfilment in which equity and human and peoples' rights are realized.

This will be a society built upon peoples' sovereignty and participation. It will be founded on social, economic, gender and environmental justice and be free from all forms of domination and exploitation, such as neoliberalism, corporate globalization, neo-colonialism and militarism.

We believe that our children's future will be better because of what we do.</code></p>
